# solc-select
A script to quickly switch between Solidity compiler versions.

It is becoming increasingly hard to run older versions of `solc`,
particularly on macOS since there are no official binary releases.
Versions prior to 0.5.0 no longer compile on macOS and are not
maintained. This is a problem because older Ethereum contracts no
longer compile on modern versions of Solidity. `solc-select` is a
utility that allows one to run _any_ legacy version of Solidity simply
by setting an environment variable.

## Quickstart

### OS X:
```
docker pull trailofbits/solc-select
docker run --read-only -i --rm --entrypoint='/bin/sh' trailofbits/solc-select:latest -c 'cat /usr/bin/install.sh' | bash -e
```

This will install `solc` globally. If `solc` is already installed, you
will be prompted to overwrite it.

To install `solc` to a different directory, run the `docker` command or
the install script, with the environment variable `PREFIX` set; `solc`
will be installed to `${PREFIX}/bin/solc`.

Alternatively, manually copy [the special solc script](bin/solc) to your desired location.

### Linux
```
git clone https://github.com/crytic/solc-select.git
./solc-select/scripts/install.sh
```

This will install `solc` into ~/.solc-select/, so you have to add it to the PATH variable. Add this line, replacing USERNAME with your username, to your `.bashrc` or equivalent:

```
export PATH=/home/USERNAME/.solc-select:$PATH
```


## Usage

The desired version of `solc` can be set with the `use` command. By default, the latest version is used.

```
$ solc --version
solc, the solidity compiler commandline interface
Version: 0.5.2+commit.1df8f40c.Linux.g++
$ solc use 0.4.24
solc, the solidity compiler commandline interface
Version: 0.4.24+commit.e67f0147.Linux.g++
```


In special scenarios the current version can also be overwritten with the `SOLC_VERSION` environment variable.

```
$ solc --version
solc, the solidity compiler commandline interface
Version: 0.4.24+commit.e67f0147.Linux.g++
$ SOLC_VERSION=0.5.2 solc --version
solc, the solidity compiler commandline interface
Version: 0.5.2+commit.1df8f40c.Linux.g++
```


You can list all available versions with the special `--versions` argument:
```
$ solc --versions
0.4.11
0.4.12
0.4.13
0.4.14
0.4.15
0.4.16
0.4.17
0.4.18
0.4.19
0.4.20
0.4.21
0.4.22
0.4.23
0.4.24
0.4.25
0.5.0
0.5.1
0.5.2
0.5.3
0.5.4
0.5.5
nightly
```

## Upgrading

Once installed, simply run
```
solc --upgrade
```
to automatically upgrade `solc-select`. This will automatically pull the latest Docker image (or repo source, depending on your OS) and upgrade the local `solc` script, if necessary. The [DockerHub image for `solc-select`](https://hub.docker.com/r/trailofbits/solc-select) will automatically update every time Solidity is updated, which will typically be nightly.

## Installation from Source on OS X

```
$ git clone https://github.com/trailofbits/solc-select.git
$ cd solc-select
$ docker build -t trailofbits/solc-select:latest .
$ bin/solc --install
```
